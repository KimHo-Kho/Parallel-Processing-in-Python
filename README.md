In python, the multiprocessing module is used to run independent parallel processes by using subprocesses (instead of threads).
It allows you to leverage multiple processors on a machine (both Windows and Unix), which means, the processes can be run in completely
separate memory locations. By the end of this tutorial you would know:

How to structure the code and understand the syntax to enable parallel processing using multiprocessing?
How to implement synchronous and asynchronous parallel processing?
How to parallelize a Pandas DataFrame?
Solve 3 different usecases with the multiprocessing.Pool() interface.
